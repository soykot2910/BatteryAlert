BatteryAlert - Smart Battery Charging Monitor for macOS

A lightweight menu bar application that monitors your Mac's battery level and provides intelligent alerts to help maintain optimal battery health.

Installation Instructions:
1. Unzip the file
2. Move BatteryAlert.app to your Applications folder
3. Right-click on BatteryAlert.app and select "Open"
4. Click "Open" in the security dialog that appears
5. The app will appear in your menu bar as a battery icon

Features:
- **Smart Charging Alerts**: Get notified when to plug in or unplug your charger
- **Customizable Thresholds**: Set your preferred low and high battery percentage levels
- **Low Battery Alert**: Receive notifications when battery drops below your set threshold (default: 21%)
- **High Battery Alert**: Get reminded to unplug when battery reaches your high threshold (default: 79%)
- **Configurable Check Intervals**: Adjust how often the app checks battery status (minimum 30 seconds)
- **Sound Notifications**: Toggle audio alerts on/off
- **Auto-start at Login**: Option to automatically launch when you start your Mac
- **Menu Bar Integration**: Easy access to settings and status from the menu bar

How It Works:
- When your battery level drops below the low threshold while unplugged, you'll get an alert to plug in the charger
- When your battery level reaches the high threshold while charging, you'll get an alert to unplug the charger
- This helps maintain optimal battery health by preventing overcharging and deep discharges

Settings (accessible via menu bar):
- **Low Threshold (L)**: Set the battery percentage that triggers "plug in" alerts
- **High Threshold (H)**: Set the battery percentage that triggers "unplug" alerts  
- **Check Interval (I)**: Set how frequently the app monitors battery status
- **Sound Notifications (S)**: Toggle audio alerts on/off
- **Start at Login (L)**: Enable/disable automatic startup

Note: When first launching the app, you'll be asked to allow notifications. Click "Allow" to receive battery alerts.

If you see a security warning, this is normal for apps not from the App Store. You can safely open the app by:
1. Right-clicking the app
2. Selecting "Open"
3. Clicking "Open" in the security dialog
